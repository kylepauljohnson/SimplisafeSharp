# SimplisafeSharp

SimplisafeSharp is a Simplisafe class wrapper for the undocumented HTTP API used by the Simplisafe iOS application.  The libary will allow you to perform the basic functions of the Simplisafe alarm system including multiple locations, arming, disarming etc.

All the credit for API discovery as well as documenting the API that is used here goes to http://www.leftovercode.info/simplisafe.php.
